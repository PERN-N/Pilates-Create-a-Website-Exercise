		<h6>I have enjoyed exercise in more of high intensity, but have been suffering from hamstring injuries first in my right leg and as we speak in the left one.
		This has encouraged me to find alternative ways of moving in a more indulgent way for the body in the aim of rehabilitation as getting to know and listen to my body as well as add mobility.</h6>

		<ol>  <!-- span to have the image and text side by side -->
			<li><span class="text_bold">Concentration</span> – This highlights that during Pilates you should focus on your entire body to ensure smooth movements.  This is hard. In Pilates exercise technique and how exercises are performed is, in many respects, more important than the exercises themselves.</li>
			<li><span class="text_bold">Control</span> – Every exercise in Pilates must be done with control.  Fundamentally its about you being in control of your body.</li>
			<li><span class="text_bold">Centering</span> – To effectively control your body you must have a starting place and that place is your center.  You’ll often hear this called the ‘powerhouse’ which is a term that means your center and encompasses the abs, upper and lower back, hips, butt and inner thighs.  All movement in Pilates should begin from your center, your powerhouse and flow out to the limbs.</li>
			<li><span class="text_bold">Flow</span> – Exercises within Pilates are intended to flow into each other to help build strength and stamina.  The use of appropriate transitions and economy of movement is highly prized and is one of the key things that differentiates novice and advanced practitioners.</li>
			<li><span class="text_bold">Precision</span> – Pilates is not about doing many repetition poorly or with poor technique. Rather Pilates aims for precise and perfect movement.  With regular Pilates and expert instruction this precision will eventually become second nature and carry over into everyday life.  An expert Pilates instructor can tell a lot about a person by simply watching them walk.</li>
			<li><span class="text_bold">Breathing</span> – Typically in Pilates you focus on breathing out with effort and in on the return.  Coordinating breathing with movement is an important part of Pilates and good instructors will continually remind you when to breathe in and when to breathe out. Like everything in Pilates you should concentrate on each breathe and feel the engagement of your powerhouse.</li>
